<h2>About Us</h2>

They took that ambition, and set out to fulfill their goal of helping as many as posssible. Everyone involved within this organization has had moment where they have needed help, understanding what it's like to be in need of help and not recieve it. And others have the same ambition that the creators had to help others.</p>

<h2>What is the purpose of the Sneaker Ball?</h2>
	<p>The purpose is to spread awareness and gain possible donations for children in need. All while also creating a fun, family event that people around the community can enjoy. </p>
	
	<p>About 2.5 Million children suffer from homelessness and do not have their own home nor bed to sleep on. About 443,000 children are cycling within the foster care system. And as many may know, those children may not be getting the best of care, or are struggling to provide for their own need and wants occasionally. As a whole, many can come to a consensus that these children should not be living the life that they do. Especially those who have joined this organization, can agree with one another, that these children should have these worries and burdens on their shoulders. We began hosting this sneakerball to educate the people on this issue, and spread awareness in order to ease the pain on the children. Starting with a new pair shoes can make a big impact on the lives of those who had been needing, but unable to get a new pair.  </p>
